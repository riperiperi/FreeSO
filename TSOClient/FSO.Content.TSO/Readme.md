# FSO.Content.TSO

This project contains TSO specific content for FreeSO. It will be imported on both the FreeSO Client and Server, but not in Simitone.

## Objects and Patches

Most objects and some patches were provided by the community during FreeSO's initial run from 2017 to 2024. For more information, visit https://freeso.org . In future, an exhaustive list of contributors will be added.

### Parsimonious Objects

Objects prefixed with k8 and stp are from Parsimonious. These were not officially part of the FreeSO catalog, but because of server history they are included since some properties contain these objects. These objects are used with permission and not really ported properly to TSO, so your mileage may vary if you attempt to use them yourself.

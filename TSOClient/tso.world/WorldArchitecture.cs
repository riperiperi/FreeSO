    /// Draws architecture in the world. As these elements cannot be semitransparent, they are drawn before all objects.
    /// 
    /// Terrain:
    /// TerrainComponent (BlendMode.NonPremultiplied)
    /// Draw grass. Shared component, but slightly different draw modes.
    /// 
    /// Floors:
    /// 3DFloorGeometry (BlendMode.Opaque (normal), BlendMode.NonPremultiplied (water))
    /// Drawing is typically handled by TerrainComponent. Geometry updates should be partial - changes will be handled by BlueprintChanges and only update
    /// floor geometry groups that have experienced a change (add/subtract)
    /// 
    /// Walls:
    /// WallComponent, WallComponentRC (BlendMode.Opaque)
    /// In 3D, these are drawn via prebuilt geometry groups. (grouped by texture, split into a grid)
    /// In 2D, these are drawn via prebuilt sprite lists. (grouped by texture, split into a grid)
    /// Both modes use a spatial update system, handled by BlueprintChanges. 
    /// The current floor is split into a grid, while other floors (and surrounds) are still kept whole. 
    /// (closest to divisible by 10, if prime or too far then default to 10. default tso is 77x77, so has 7x7 grid of size 11)
    /// 
    /// Roofs:
    /// RoofComponent
    /// This component is due some refactoring to improve performance of the re-generation step. For now, it is only regenerated when it is seen,
    /// and when any floor is changed beneath it.
    /// Likely the best option would be to use a rectangular dirty map similar to the walls, but also include floor changes. Any roofs touching the
    /// union of the dirty rectangles are also combined with it, then the scan and re-roof are done over that region.
    /// 
    /// === (CO-)DEPENDANCES BETWEEN ARCHITECTURE LAYERS ===
    /// 
    /// Walls depend on Floors: for lighting separation between floors
    /// When a floor is added, the walls around it may start or stop receiving light from the floor above or below.
    /// This one is easy - since walls are dirtied spatially, simply include floor changes in the wall spatial dirty region. (for the relevant floors)
    /// 
    /// Floors depend on walls: Diagonal floors are stored in wall tiles
    /// Needs smarter handling of "dirtying" the wall tile - eg. detect the diag floor tile has changed and send the command to the floor change list rather than the wall one
    /// 
    /// Roofs depend on floors and walls: Roofs only appear on top of indoors rooms, do not appear on floor tiles.
    /// Admittedly hard to solve. We can use some spatial tricks to avoid updating all tiles and rectangles, propagating the dirty region through existing roofs.
    /// 
    /// === OPTIONAL DRAW MODES ===
    /// 
    /// Surround:
    /// Same as above.
    /// 
    /// Potential Future Option for less object/wall z-fighting through upper floors (2D):
    /// Draw only one floor at a time. This could be done with a slight depth bias to make sure we cover walls and objects on the previous floor.
    /// (assumes depth bias can be applied during depth compare, but NOT for depth write. otherwise we'd have to bias each floor.)

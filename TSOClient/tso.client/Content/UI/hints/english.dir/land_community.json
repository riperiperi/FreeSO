    "body": "Town halls, parks, law enforcement buildings or even prisons - lots of this type are the center of the neighborhood, and reflect the most excentric nature of its inhabitants. This special lot type can be opened by anyone, has a max sim limit of 128, making them ideal for get-togethers like competitions, weddings and other celebrations. There are also exclusive objects you can only find on community lots, mainly to do with voting and the bulletin board. However, lots with this type cannot be given a lot category, so it's not much good at anything else!\nEach neighborhood has one community lot owned by its Mayor, who has been nominated and elected by its residents. The mayor has complete control over the property, though they can enlist help via object 'donations' from whitelisted sims. \n\nMotives: [s][color=#FFA64D]Average[/color][/s], Speciality: [s]Openable by anyone, 128 object max limit, high object limit for donations.[/s]"
